Car Cluster Drawings for "Will You Wheel"

Welcome to the "Car Cluster Drawings" project repository, dedicated to providing detailed car cluster drawings for the PC game "Will You Wheel." These drawings were crafted using the design tool Figma, and I aimed to replicate the intricate instrument clusters found in real cars to enhance the game's realism.

Project Description

"Will You Wheel" is a steam game that aims for a high level of detail and authenticity in its representation of various cars. As part of my learning journey, I've taken on the task of creating realistic and accurate car cluster drawings for the game. These clusters are essential for providing players with an immersive driving experience.


Contributions and Updates

While this project is currently a personal initiative, I am open to making updates if the game's developer requests additional or revised clusters. Collaboration and feedback from the developer would be a valuable opportunity to further enhance the in-game experience.
